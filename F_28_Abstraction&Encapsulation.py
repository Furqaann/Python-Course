# Abstraction
"""
Abstraction is each single entity performing specific task.
Example: In a School, Teachers teach students, Students learn, Admin staff perform administrative duties
Every one has a role and does not interfere in eachothers work.

This complete School could be a layer of abstraction for another entity, 
In a Complete Educational system, this school is a layer of abstraction 

Dividing work in different things and developed by different persons and integrated in the end.
"""
# Encapsulation
"""
Implementation is hidden from the end user.
If a user wants to run an addition function , he/she just needs to know that he/she has to enter 2 digits and enter 
the addition button. Every thing else is npt important for user he/she doesn't need to know.
